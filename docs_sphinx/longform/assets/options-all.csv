gad_init_vel_from_pos_[enabled],"on/off. Enable dynamic velocity initialisation from GAD position data"
gad_init_hea_from_pos_[enabled],"on/off. Enable dynamic heading initialisation from position data"
gad_lrf[lrf_id]_[lat]_[lon]_[alt]_[yaw]_[pitch]_[roll],"Angles are expected in degrees. lat, lon and alt should be the origin of your local frame.  This command sets a new GAD local reference frame with a specified Id. The lrf_id is a unique identifier for each local reference frame. Up to 32 reference frames can be defined in this way. Once the local refence frame has been defined, it must be associated to the stream Id of the relevant aiding so that the INS knows which local reference frame to use for a particular aiding source"
gad_lrf_id[stream_id]_[lrf_id],"This command sets a specific GAD stream_id to use the lrf_id"
gad_init_vel_from_pos_[enabled],"on/off. This command allows the system to create its own estimate of velocity from a GAD position stream, meaning the system can initialise. For initialisation to occur, the velocity in a straight line must exceed the 'motion speed' option (default 5 m/s) for a few seconds. This may be changed using the below command, although reducing this speed is not recommended"
motion_speed[speed],"Set speed for dynamic initialisation, in m/s (default 5.0). It is important to note that the position updates (from a single stream) must be more regular than 1Hz for velocity to be calculated. More than 5 Hz is highly recommended. Furthermore, if there are any available velocity streams, the system will use these for initialisation, rather than the position streams, regardless of this option being set"
gad_init_hea_from_pos_[enabled],"*In development. on/off. If the velocity initialisation is being performed from position data, this option can also be set to allow the heading to be dynamically initialised from this velocity. As with the velocity from position aiding, if an actual heading stream is available, the system will use that for initialisation, assuming it reaches the usual thresholds for variance level"
